# Company Image Support Implementation

This document outlines the implementation of image support for companies in the Flutter Web application, including all CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

## Overview

Image support has been added to the company management system, allowing users to:
- Upload company logos/images from their computer
- Convert images to BASE64 format for API transmission
- Display company images in the companies table
- Edit and update company images
- Validate image formats and sizes

## Files Modified/Created

### 1. Company Model (`lib/core/models/company_model.dart`)

**Changes Made:**
- Added `final String? image;` field to the `Company` class
- Updated `Company.fromJson()` to parse image from JSON response
- Updated `Company.toJson()` to include image in JSON output
- Updated `Company.copyWith()` to handle image field
- Updated `operator ==` and `hashCode` to include image field
- Added `image` field to `CompanyCreateRequest` and `CompanyUpdateRequest`
- Modified `toJson()` methods to conditionally include image field

**Purpose:** Extends the data model to support image storage and transmission.

### 2. Image Utilities (`lib/core/utils/image_utils.dart`) - NEW FILE

**Features:**
- `pickImageFile()`: Picks image files from user's computer using `file_picker`
- `fileToBase64()`: Converts `PlatformFile` to BASE64 string
- `base64ToImageBytes()`: Converts BASE64 string back to image bytes
- `isValidBase64Image()`: Validates BASE64 image strings
- `getFileSize()`: Formats file sizes for human readability
- `showImagePickerDialog()`: Shows image picker with validation and error handling

**Validation Rules:**
- Maximum file size: 5MB
- Supported formats: jpg, jpeg, png, gif, webp
- Automatic file extension and size validation

**Purpose:** Provides reusable utility functions for image handling across the application.

### 3. Company Image Picker Widget (`lib/core/widgets/company_image_picker.dart`) - NEW FILE

**Features:**
- Displays existing company image or placeholder
- Image upload/selection interface
- Image preview with edit/remove actions
- Loading states during image processing
- Error handling for invalid images
- Responsive design matching existing UI components

**UI Components:**
- Image display area (200x200 pixels by default)
- Company logo placeholder when no image is selected
- Edit button to change existing image
- Remove button to clear selected image
- Select Image button for initial image selection
- Error text display for validation issues

**Purpose:** Reusable widget for image selection and display in company forms.

### 4. Company Management Page (`lib/pages/companies/company_management_page.dart`)

**Changes Made:**
- Added imports for image utilities and image picker widget
- Added "Logo" column to the companies table
- Integrated `CompanyImagePicker` in Add Company form
- Integrated `CompanyImagePicker` in Edit Company form
- Added image display in table rows
- Changed modal types from `medium` to `large` to accommodate image picker
- Added helper methods for building company images and placeholders

**Table Changes:**
- New "Logo" column between "Name" and "Address"
- Image display with fallback to company initial placeholder
- Responsive image sizing (40x40 pixels in table)

**Form Changes:**
- Company Logo Section with blue-themed styling
- Company Information Section with grey-themed styling
- Image picker integration with existing form validation
- BASE64 image storage and transmission

## API Integration

### Image Handling Flow

1. **Image Selection**: User selects image file from computer
2. **Validation**: File format and size validation
3. **Conversion**: Image converted to BASE64 string
4. **Transmission**: BASE64 string sent with API requests
5. **Storage**: Image stored in company record
6. **Display**: Image displayed in UI when available

### API Request Changes

**Create Company:**
```json
{
  "name": "Company Name",
  "address": "Company Address",
  "phone": "Company Phone",
  "image": "base64_encoded_image_string"
}
```

**Update Company:**
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Updated Name",
  "address": "Updated Address",
  "phone": "Updated Phone",
  "image": "base64_encoded_image_string"
}
```

## UI/UX Features

### Form Design
- **Company Logo Section**: Blue-themed container with image picker
- **Company Information Section**: Grey-themed container with form fields
- **Responsive Layout**: Forms adapt to different screen sizes
- **Visual Feedback**: Loading states, error messages, success indicators

### Table Display
- **Logo Column**: Dedicated column for company images
- **Image Thumbnails**: 40x40 pixel rounded image display
- **Fallback Placeholders**: Company initial when no image is available
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback for invalid images

### Image Management
- **Drag & Drop**: File picker integration for easy image selection
- **Preview**: Real-time image preview before saving
- **Edit/Remove**: Easy image modification and removal
- **Validation**: Clear error messages for invalid files

## Technical Implementation

### Dependencies Used
- `file_picker`: For selecting image files from user's computer
- `dart:convert`: For BASE64 encoding/decoding
- `dart:typed_data`: For handling image bytes

### State Management
- Image state managed within `CompanyImagePicker` widget
- BASE64 strings passed to parent forms via callbacks
- Form state includes image data for API requests

### Error Handling
- File format validation
- File size validation
- BASE64 conversion error handling
- API error handling with user-friendly messages

## Usage Examples

### Adding a Company with Image
1. Click "Add Company" button
2. Select company logo using image picker
3. Fill in company information
4. Click "Save" - image is automatically converted to BASE64 and sent

### Editing Company Image
1. Click edit button on company row
2. Use image picker to change logo
3. Click "Save" - updated image is sent to API

### Viewing Company Images
- Company images automatically display in the Logo column
- Placeholder shown for companies without images
- Error handling for corrupted or invalid images

## Benefits

1. **Enhanced User Experience**: Visual company representation
2. **Professional Appearance**: Company logos improve table aesthetics
3. **Easy Management**: Simple image upload and editing
4. **Data Integrity**: Validation ensures only valid images are stored
5. **Responsive Design**: Works across different screen sizes
6. **Reusable Components**: Image picker can be used in other parts of the app

## Future Enhancements

1. **Image Cropping**: Add image editing capabilities
2. **Multiple Formats**: Support for additional image formats
